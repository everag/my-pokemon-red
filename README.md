# my-pokemon-red

Attempt to create a custom patcher for Pokémon Red where the player can customize their own version with their personal preferences such as:
- Original Japanese or US version sprites (customizable per Pokémon)
- Units of measure (kg/lbs, ft/cm)

Stretch goals
- Preferred pronouns (is the protagonist even referred by pronouns?)
- Boy or Girl protagonist (can just get gen2 girl sprite)
- Swap "throw rock" with "throw mud" in the safari game

# Project Stage
- Pre-conception and POC stage. Need to understand the binary format of the ROMs and where the sprites are before anything else.
